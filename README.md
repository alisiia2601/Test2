The app is build using create-react-app

You are building an app where you can vote on three pokemons. 
The one with the most votes will be displayed as the winner, or if there's a tie, it should display that tie instead.
You should be able to change the name of the pokemons that you are voting for (plese note that the names displaying the winners will remain as the default names).
